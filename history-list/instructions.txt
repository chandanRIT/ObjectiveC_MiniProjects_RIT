Lab 2: Memory management

Part 1:
Implement a circular list by filling in the empty methods in CommandHistory.m and Node.m.  Follow the comments within the method bodies and in the header files.

Run test.m and verify that your output is OK.
Examine your code to see if your reference counts are correct.  You will need to call retain and release as well as C's free().

Part 2:

You will now use your circular list to store commands made through a dummy shell. These commands can also be saved to a clipboard within the shell.

The following special commands are available in the shell:

getHistory (implemented for you*)
getSaved (implemented for you*)
save [command id] [slot id]
exec [slot id]
setHistorySize (implemented for you*)

Save and exec save commands from the history and allow you to run them later.

*will only work with a fully functional part 1 implementation

Open shell.m and fill in the missing code.  There are numerous memory management omissions as well, so find and fix them.
As before, you will need to call ratain and release in various places.

Once done, compile using the command in compile.txt and run your shell.

See if your output is the same as that in samplerun.txt.
Ensure that your reference counts are correct.  We do not provide any explicit tests for this.

For a fully working solution you will need to edit CommandHistory.m, Node.m, and shell.m.
To receive full credit, you should have no memory leaks and all memory should be freed on exit.

Exit the shell using Control+D to ensure that all of your routines get executed.
